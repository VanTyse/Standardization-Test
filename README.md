#This project was created using React and is hosted on Neflify at https://vantyse-standardization-test.netlify.app 
This is a front end project.

In the src there is a users.json file that sort of stands as data gotten from a database of users. 
Properties in the file include email, password, name and id.
When signing in, only users that exist in the users.json file can be authenticated.
Also, each user has it's own password (which for ease is 'qwerty1234' for all users.
